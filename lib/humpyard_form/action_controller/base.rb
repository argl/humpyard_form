# register a custom json renderer for humpyard form to overcome xhr file upload limits.
# if a file input is present in the form, it should be sent as a normal form
# submit, targeted to a (hidden) iframe. client code can pick up the response from there.
# two things with this workaround: the MIME type cannot be the proper json type
# because the response would end up being downloaded by common browsers.
# additionally, there is some escaping going on in the browser which can
# render the json unparseable. to prevent this, we send the json wrapped
# in a <textarea> element. (this is the way jquery.form handles things)
# until there is a decent way to upload files using xhr (also supporting 
# streaming large uploads), we have to use this rather ugly hack.
# this code is based on the original rails :json option for rendering.
# to use the workaround, include a parameter url_quirk=true in the request.
